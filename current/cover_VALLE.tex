%aHEADLINE
%Quantitative-oriented Biologist skilled in high-dimensional data analysis
%
%aPROFILE
%
%aEXPERIENCE
%
%At NAMRU-6, I implemented data analysis tools for immunoassays, of large- and short-scale, 
%relevant for Malaria surveillance and research. 
%Using R as statistical computing software, I developed reproducible workflows for the 
%(i) standardization of high-throughput ELISA assays for sero-surveillance, 
%(ii) modeling and visualization of Protein microarrays for large-scale Antibody Profiles 
%in response to infections with applications on vaccine candidates discovery, and 
%(iii) short-scale Dose-reponse assays to test drug resistance or total parasite biomass.
%
%At my home university, I gained bench experience doing laboratory research in a hot topic: 
%Magnetic field effects on animal reproduction. 
%Working hand-in-hand with Electrical Engineers, a novel and custom experimental setting 
%was developed, with induction coils and a humidity chamber, 
%to assess in vitro how sperm quality response to a extremely low frequency field. 
%From the writing proposal to a conference poster presentation, almost all the steps of 
%research activity were covered.
%
%aSUMMARY
%
%Andree Valle-Campos is a quantitative-oriented biologist highly interested in interdisciplinary research. 
%Working in the interphase between Epidemiology and large-scale Immunology, 
%he became fluent in R and enthusiastic for more computational applications 
%into its daily research. In parallel, he is also keen on applying and teaching formal approaches 
%aimed to understand the inner logic of biological systems.

\opening{Dear Dr. Stephen Quake and Dr. Joseph DeRisi:} 
 
\noindent 
My name is Andree Valle Campos and I am a BS in Genetics and Biotechnology doing independent research.

\noindent 
As you can read from my CV, I have a strong experience in the fields of statistics and malaria immunology. 
During the last year, I was immersed in the problematic around immunoassay data analysis methods. 
In order to solve this issue, I developed two main reproducible workflows for current short-scale and future routine high-throughput assays. 
These improvements would have a relevant impact in malaria sero-surveillance and vaccine development protocols.

\noindent 
This experience introduced me to the problem of 'big data' in immunology. 
For this reason, a next step in my career is to contribute with multiple source data integration methods. 
This approach would allow us not only to read, but to understand biological data through modeling. 
That is why I am very interested in your awesome efforts on automated biological experiments using microfluidics. 
Although minimalistic, this improvement would allow us to measure different sources of information, 
from intracellular to extracellular responses, and estimate their variability in a more controlled fashion. 
I thought that the CZ BioHub may have the great environment to further study this hypothesis.

\noindent 
As you can also gather from my CV, 
I have participated in schools and courses in different countries, all involving interdisciplinary research. 
From these experiences I expanded my scientific horizons, improved my communication abilities and openness to other cultures. 
I also gave University classes for two years, sharing some of my learnings and theoretical perspectives.

\noindent 
I believe that my presence in the CZ BioHub would be a great benefit to everyone. 
I am enthusiastic about the possibility of working together and I hope to hear from you very soon.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}

%aGRAND LOCUS Notes:
%
%(1) Say immediately what stage of your career you are. 
%This is particularly important if you apply to an open call, as you will compete with hundreds of applicants and readers will have very little time to read your letter.
%
%(2) Tell your domain(s) of expertise. 
%By the third sentence, the reader must know how much experience you have (this is the previous note) and what you are good at.
%
%(3) Explain your choices. 
%Do not hesitate to say what you like, what fascinates you. 
%The reader will most likely be a scientist too, so genuine enthusiasm for your research will work better than career objectives.
%
%(4) Say what you want to do next. 
%This shows that you know where you are going.
%
%(5) Show some interest for the lab. 
%Check their website and their research lines. Mention this in your text along with some published work. 
%Propose something, even if this is naive or preliminary.
%
%(6) Interpret your CV. 
%This may seem obvious, but you can use the end of the cover letter to explain how your experience demonstrates your other qualities. 


%aMORE TEMPLATE NOTES
%
%aPARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
%of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
%learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
%newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
% 
%aPARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
%how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life. 
% 
%aPARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
%flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
%the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
%example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
%located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
%Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
%interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
%time to consider your credentials.
