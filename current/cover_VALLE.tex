%aHEADLINE
%Quantitative-oriented Biologist skilled in high-dimensional data analysis
%
%aPROFILE
%
%aEXPERIENCE
%
%At NAMRU-6, I implemented data analysis tools for immunoassays, of large- and short-scale, 
%relevant for Malaria surveillance and research. 
%Using R as statistical computing software, I developed reproducible workflows for the 
%(i) standardization of high-throughput ELISA assays for sero-surveillance, 
%(ii) modeling and visualization of Protein microarrays for large-scale Antibody Profiles 
%in response to infections with applications on vaccine candidates discovery, and 
%(iii) short-scale Dose-reponse assays to test drug resistance or total parasite biomass.
%
%At my home university, I gained bench experience doing laboratory research in a hot topic: 
%Magnetic field effects on animal reproduction. 
%Working hand-in-hand with Electrical Engineers, a novel and custom experimental setting 
%was developed, with induction coils and a humidity chamber, 
%to assess in vitro how sperm quality response to a extremely low frequency field. 
%From the writing proposal to a conference poster presentation, almost all the steps of 
%research activity were covered.
%
%aSUMMARY
%
%Andree Valle-Campos is a quantitative-oriented biologist highly interested in interdisciplinary research. 
%Working in the interphase between Epidemiology and large-scale Immunology, 
%he became fluent in R and enthusiastic for more computational applications 
%into its daily research. In parallel, he is also keen on applying and teaching formal approaches 
%aimed to understand the inner logic of biological systems.

%\opening{To whom it may concern:} 
 
\noindent 
%My name is Andree Valle Campos and 
%I am a BSc in Genetics and Biotechnology with 3 years of experience on computational research. 
%after receiving this degree. %of independent
%\noindent 
I write to you in order to express my interest in the application for the Genomics Data Analyst position,
which I learned from the twitter account of the Bioinformatics Barcelona Association (@BiBcn).

\noindent 
I introduce myself as a quantitative-oriented biologist with 3 years of experience on computational research. 
As you can read from my CV, I have a strong experience in the fields of Genomics Data Science and Bioinformatics. 
While working in the interphase between Epidemiology and large-scale Immunology, 
I implemented reproducible data analysis workflows and, as a result, gained fluency in R, several programming languages and other computational tools that optimized my daily research.
Furthermore, formal learning in fields like phylogenetics and structural genomics, gave me
a in-depth understanding and critical perspective in the required field.
%I was immersed in the problematic around immunoassay non-reproducible data analysis methods. 
%In order to solve this issue, I developed two main reproducible workflows for current short-scale and future routine high-throughput assays. 
%These improvements would have a relevant impact in malaria sero-surveillance and vaccine development protocols.
%\noindent 
%This experience introduced me to the problem of 'big data' in immunology. 
%For this reason, a next step in my career is to contribute with multiple source data integration methods. 
%This approach would allow us not only to read, but to understand biological data through modeling. 
%That is why I am very interested in your awesome efforts on automated biological experiments using microfluidics. 
%Although minimalistic, this improvement would allow us to measure different sources of information, 
%from intracellular to extracellular responses, and estimate their variability in a more controlled fashion. 
%I thought that the CZ BioHub may have the great environment to further study this hypothesis.

\noindent 
As you can also gather from my CV, 
I have participated in schools and courses in different countries, all involving interdisciplinary work and hands-on training with internationally recognized researchers. 
From these experiences I expanded my scientific horizons, improved my communication abilities and openness to other cultures. 
I also gave University classes for three years, sharing some of my learnings and encouraging new people into theoretical and computational biology.

\noindent 
As an active self-learner and enthusiast for group-oriented research, I am extremely sure that a challenging environment as the CNAG-CRG would improve my gained background.
I believe that my presence in your institution would be a great benefit to everyone. 
Even more, this would be a strong step in my career that would improve my possibilities to be accepted in competitive PhD programs in Europe.
I am enthusiastic about the possibility of working together and I hope to hear from you very soon.

%aGRAND LOCUS Notes:
%
%(1) Say immediately what stage of your career you are. 
%This is particularly important if you apply to an open call, as you will compete with hundreds of applicants and readers will have very little time to read your letter.
%
%(2) Tell your domain(s) of expertise. 
%By the third sentence, the reader must know how much experience you have (this is the previous note) and what you are good at.
%
%(3) Explain your choices. 
%Do not hesitate to say what you like, what fascinates you. 
%The reader will most likely be a scientist too, so genuine enthusiasm for your research will work better than career objectives.
%
%(4) Say what you want to do next. 
%This shows that you know where you are going.
%
%(5) Show some interest for the lab. 
%Check their website and their research lines. Mention this in your text along with some published work. 
%Propose something, even if this is naive or preliminary.
%
%(6) Interpret your CV. 
%This may seem obvious, but you can use the end of the cover letter to explain how your experience demonstrates your other qualities.

% a SEND example for DATA WRANGLER JOB

% Dr. Hans Ekbrand,
% 
% I write to you in order to express my interest in the application 
% for the R data wrangler consultant as a freelance job, which I learned 
% from the web page of Jobs for R-users (https://www.r-users.com/jobs/r-data-wrangler/).
% 
% I introduce myself as a biologist skilled in Data Science with 3 years 
% of experience on bioinformatic research. My interest in the position 
% came from both: the use open public datasets of demographic and health 
% data, and the application of reproducibility principles for its analysis 
% with free software. My experience as data wrangler came from my work in 
% the interfase between epidemiology and immunology. As you can gather 
% from my CV, during the last two years I self-learned and acquire fluency 
% in R and two of its major environments: Bioconductor and the Tidyverse, 
% in order to implement workflows for genome-scale experiments and integrate 
% them with raw epidemiological datasets that requiered the amazing tools 
% provided by the last one. Furthermore, Rmarkdown notebooks allowed me to 
% be polyglot by using bash (terminal) commands inside them when required.
% 
% With respect to the specific requierements, I can propose tidy alternatives 
% to the import SPSS files using haven::read_spss() 
% [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/haven/versions/1.0.0], and the 
% usage of car::recode() with forcats::fct_recode() 
% [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forcats/versions/0.2.0]. I am 
% confident that this work would allow me to improve my problem-solving 
% skills, code readability and give me the grate opportunity to start my 
% first coding collaborative work. The gained experience would also show me 
% how to apply this approach in my current research field and achieve the aim 
% to reduce the gap between data acquisition and responsiveness of the public 
% health system, in the same way as recent experiences in other fields have 
% shown (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).
% 
% I would be very grateful to request an interview and talk in more detail 
% on the issue. My schedule is flexible enough to set a meeting at a hour 
% according to your timezone (I am in GMT+5). Thanks for your time to consider 
% my credentials.
% 
% Sincerely yours,
%
